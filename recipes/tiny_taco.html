    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These beef and bean tiny tacos are made with round corn chips, filled and folded around taco-seasoned beef and refried beans, a super fun party snack.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 packet taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>48 round corn tortilla chips, from 1 (11 ounce) bag</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Mexican blend cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup taco sauce for dipping, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook while crumbling with a spatula and stirring occasionally until browned, about 5 minutes. Add taco seasoning and water and stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is well coated in seasoning. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Arrange whole chips on the bottom of 2 rimmed baking sheets. Spread each chip evenly with a thin layer of refried beans. Top evenly with taco meat and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>As soon as chips are baked, carefully fold each chip in half to form a taco shape. Place tacos on a serving platter with taco sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
